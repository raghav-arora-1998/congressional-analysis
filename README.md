# Congressional-Analysis

##Variable Explanation:
The additional variables we selected from the census data set are Employment status for district populations for those over the age of 16 total, total not in labor force, and total in labor force.

It is important to note that the labor force is made up of those who are either employed or unemployed. With actively employed persons being in the employed category and those who are actively seeking work in the unemployed category. Those who fall under neither category are considered not in the labor force.

##Hypothesis
Based on our previous analysis, we believe that republicans will have a lower labor force participation rate than democrats becuase they tend to have a higher median age, rate of disability, rate of retired individuals, rate of stay at home moms, and a lower rate of health insurance.

This is because we expect republican districts to have a higher demographic of older people and others who support their platforms based on so called traditional family values. Amongst this group we expect that older people will be retired as well as be more likely to have a disability. We also expect women who work from home are more likely to support republicans due to their support of the nuclear family. Since the democratic party traditionally supports healthcare for all we expect that districts which are controlled by democrats will have more constituents with health care coverage. Households with healthcare are less likely to be out of the labor force as they will not need to stay home to take care of others.

##Previous Hypothesis
According to the bureau of labor statistics those who fall in the category of not in the labor force are typically either in school, retired, or have family responsibilities such as caring for a sick family member. We hypothesize that these groups are all more likely to support democratic congressional candidates. We believe college students are more likely to support democratic candidates due to social believes and potential student loan payouts, retired persons are more likely to support democratic candidates as they typically support medicare and medicaid programs that will benefit the elderly, and those caring for the sick are more likely to support democratic candidates due to their support of healthcare programs.

##Data collection and Wrangling
Our variables:
B23025_001E: EMPLOYMENT STATUS FOR THE POPULATION 16 YEARS AND OVER
Estimate!!Total:
B23025_007E: EMPLOYMENT STATUS FOR THE POPULATION 16 YEARS AND OVER
Estimate!!Total:!!Not in labor force
B23025_002E: EMPLOYMENT STATUS FOR THE POPULATION 16 YEARS AND OVER
Estimate!!Total:!!In labor force \

Party Dominance Ratio
To better assess how the "Not in Labor Force Rate" would impact/reflect the political affiliation we categorize the US states political affiliation based on more griadient political affiliation variable with One (Solid Red) represending states with 100% of the congressional districts dominated by Republicans and and Zero being the states with 100% democrares domination.

The plot provide didn't provide support for our original hypothesis where the Red/Republican dominant states are having relatively higher values of "Not in Labor Force Rate", compared to the Blue/Democratic demonant states

## District Level Analysis

### Variance Analysis

In This part we tried to understand the main factor behind the wide range of "Not in Labor Force Rate" among different states/districts, spaning from 25% up to 57% on district level
While there are many reasons for not being in Labor Force, we found that that it is highly correlated with the age group distribution, clearly the higher the "Population Median Age" on a district level the higher the "Not in Labor Force Rate"
Additionally, The Republican districts are generally having higher "Median Age" which is providing good explanation for higher "Not in Labor Force Rate(s)" among the Rebuplican states/districts as observed from the previous map view.

### Congressional District Grouping
While we have many democratic and also republican districts with relatively high but also low "Not In Labor Force rates" we do believe that we should have significant demographic and behavioral differences between both parties.
To better identify those differences we will creat four distict district groups as follow
Democratic districts with high "Not in Labor Force Rate" (4th Quartile)
Republican districts with high "Not in Labor Force Rate" (4th Quartile)
Democratic districts with Low "Not in Labor Force Rate" (1st Quartile)
Republican districts with Low "Not in Labor Force Rate" (1st Quartile)
Demographic and behavioral Analysis
After splitting our data into high and low Not in Labor Force groups we looked into the below four variables we believed would be the most differentiating ones
Disability
Retirement
Stay at home mothers
Health Insurance
high_NIL_Percent = merged_df[merged_df['% of households not in labor force'] >= 43]

low_NIL_Percent = merged_df[merged_df['% of households not in labor force'] < 43]

democrats_high = high_NIL_Percent[high_NIL_Percent['Party'] == 'D']
republicans_high = high_NIL_Percent[high_NIL_Percent['Party'] == 'R']
democrats_low = low_NIL_Percent[low_NIL_Percent['Party'] == 'D']
republicans_low = low_NIL_Percent[low_NIL_Percent['Party'] == 'R']
To try and understand what groups influence who falls into the not in labor force category we looked at the % of disabled in each group, both high NIL groups and low NIL groups.

## Conclusion:
As hypothesized republicans have a higher median age, as well as a higher percent of retired people, disabled people and lower percent of health care coverage. Due to this, they tend to have a higher not in labor force participation rate than democrats, since these are the major areas that make up the not in the labor force segment. The one variable that could be analyzed further is the rate of stay at home moms, which provides inconclusive results.
